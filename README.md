# Udemy-freebies-scraper
Simple script, based on a Google dork, that searches for the recently indexed (default 24h) Udemy’s courses for which there’s a free coupon code available.
The script tests if the coupon is expired or not available and gives you back the remaining redeeming coupons and end time of the promo.
